<h1>Minecraft: Voyager</h1>

<p><em>You and your crew have been flung to the outer edge of the world. It is your job to make it back home. You and your crew must work together to accomplish this goal along the way.</em></p>

<p>You will spawn at the farthest point of a seed along one of the coordinate axes. You must work together to return to the center of the map. Youâ€™ll be given minimal supplies; everything else you must mine, forage, and craft yourself.</p>

<p>The following tasks must be accomplished before returning home:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A mansion must be discovered and cleared.</li>
	<li>An ocean temple must be discovered and cleared.</li>
	<li>The Ender Dragon must be defeated.</li>
</ol>

<p>The crew must build a settlement any time they agree that beds should go down. A settlement requires that: 1. each bed must have a roof and four walls around it; 2. an active nether portal must be created, lit, and traversed; and 3. a banner must be placed to give the settlement a name to be decided by the crew.</p>

<p>Members of the crew may play independently, but settlements can only be created when the entire crew is online.</p>
